# 📧 Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify emails as **spam** or **not spam**. It demonstrates a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model training, 
evaluation, and prediction using Python and scikit-learn.

## 🔍 Features

- Data preprocessing and text vectorization using TF-IDF
- Training and evaluation using Naive Bayes classifier
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix evaluation
- User-friendly and modular code with visualizations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/suresh-datt-joshi/spam_email_detection_with_ml.git
   cd spam_email_detection_with_ml
   
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3.Run the notebook in Jupyter:
  jupyter notebook

**✅ Results**
The model achieves high accuracy and can effectively classify spam and non-spam emails based on the given dataset.

**📌 Future Improvements**
Add support for more ML models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)
Integrate with Flask or Streamlit for a web interface
Include a real-time email scanning feature
